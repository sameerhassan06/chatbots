# Final Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue
Build succeeds and creates files in `dist/public/` but Vercel can't find them in `dist/`.

## Final Solution Applied
Updated vercel.json to use a copy workaround:

```json
{
  "buildCommand": "vite build && mkdir -p dist && cp -r dist/public/* dist/ 2>/dev/null || true",
  "outputDirectory": "dist",
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/$1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This:
1. Runs `vite build` (creates files in dist/public/)
2. Creates dist/ directory if it doesn't exist
3. Copies all files from dist/public/ to dist/
4. Vercel finds files in the expected dist/ location

## Backup Option
If this still doesn't work, manually update package.json build script:
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

## Expected Result
✅ Successful Vercel deployment
✅ Frontend demo showcasing your platform UI
