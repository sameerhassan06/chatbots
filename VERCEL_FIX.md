# Vercel Deployment Fix

## Issue Identified
Your build command `npm run build` includes both frontend AND backend building:
```json
"build": "vite build && esbuild server/index.ts --platform=node --packages=external --bundle --format=esm --outdir=dist"
```

But Vercel static deployment only needs the frontend part.

## Solution Applied
Updated `vercel.json` to use only the frontend build command:
- Build Command: `vite build` (frontend only)
- Output Directory: `client/dist`
- Removed unnecessary backend build steps

## Next Steps
1. Push this updated `vercel.json` to GitHub
2. Redeploy on Vercel
3. The build should complete successfully now

## What Will Work
- Frontend UI and navigation
- React components and styling
- Client-side routing

## What Won't Work (Expected)
- Authentication (needs backend)
- Database operations
- API calls
- Real chatbot functionality

This creates a **frontend demo** that showcases your beautiful UI design.

For full functionality, consider Railway or Render as discussed earlier.
